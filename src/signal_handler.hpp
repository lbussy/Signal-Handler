/**
 * @brief Block all signals registered in SignalHandler::signal_map.

 *          SignalHandler class and blocks all the signals using pthread_sigmask.
 *
 *          This is commonly used in multithreaded environments to delegate
 *          signal handling to a dedicated thread, while blocking signal
 *          delivery to others.
 *
 * @note Only blocks signals listed in SignalHandler::signal_map.
 * @note Requires linking with -pthread.

 * @throws None, but will print an error to stderr if pthread_sigmask fails,
 *         provided DEBUG_SIGNAL_HANDLER is defined.

 * @brief Manages signal handling in a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * @details
 * The SignalHandler class centralizes POSIX signal handling into a dedicated
 * thread, allowing controlled asynchronous signal responses via user-defined
 * callbacks or immediate shutdown behavior.
 *
 * Signals are defined via a static `signal_map`, which maps each signal number
 * to a human-readable name and a boolean indicating whether it requires an
 * immediate process termination.
 *
 * Terminal control characters (like ^C) can also be suppressed during the
 * lifetime of the signal handler.

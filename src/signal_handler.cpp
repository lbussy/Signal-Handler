 * - SIGUSR1: User-defined signal 1 (non-fatal).
 * - SIGINT: Interrupt from keyboard (non-fatal).
 * - SIGTERM: Termination signal (non-fatal).

 * - SIGSEGV: Invalid memory reference (fatal).
 * - SIGBUS: Bus error (fatal).
 * - SIGFPE: Floating-point exception (fatal).
 * - SIGILL: Illegal instruction (fatal).
 * - SIGABRT: Abort signal (fatal).
